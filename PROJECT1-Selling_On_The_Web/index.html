  <h3>Red Striped Diner Mugs</h3>
  <img src="drinkware1-white.red.stripe.mug.JPG" alt="Two white diner mugs with red stripe" width="300">
  <p>
    The first set I’d like to share is a pair of sturdy <strong>diner mugs with a simple red stripe</strong>.
    Their heavy weight and clean design remind me of old cafés where coffee was always hot and endless.

  <h3>Orange Ceramic Cup</h3>

  <p>
    Another favorite is this <strong>orange handmade ceramic cup from Gloucester, MA</strong>.
    Its earthy tone and uneven shape give it a natural charm that mass-produced items can’t capture.

  <h3>Burgundy Stemmed Glass</h3>

  <p>
    This <strong>small wine or cocktail glass</strong> was thrifted in Hudson, NY recently.
    Its deep burgundy stem with a playful zigzag design makes it stand out as both elegant and fun.
    They are reminiscent of retro <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libbey_Incorporated" target="_blank">Libbey</a> Zigzag Martini glasses.

  <h3>Speckled Stoneware Mugs</h3>

  <p>
    This <strong>set of two handmade speckled stoneware mugs</strong> was given as a Christmas gift from a friend.
    They are shallow, but wider than most other items in my collection, making them a unique addition.

  <p>Price: $36.00 + shipping</p>
