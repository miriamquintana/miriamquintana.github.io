  <h2>Our Story</h2>
  <p>
    Música, Maestro began with a few friends swapping records between dorm rooms, chasing the feeling of home through sound. What started as a small student borrowing program grew into something much larger. It became a gathering place for people who see music as a way to connect, remember, and celebrate. Over time, the store found its own rhythm, alive with conversation, discovery, and community.
  </p>

  <h2>The Meaning Behind the Name</h2>
  <p>
    The name came from a memory close to our founder’s heart. Josefina Ortiz grew up watching <em>Sábado Gigante</em> with her mom every Saturday night, both of them cheering along with the host’s call, “¡Música, Maestro!” That phrase carried joy, energy, and a sense of belonging. It captured everything she wanted her record store to represent. Today, that spirit still echoes through every corner of our space.
  </p>

  <h2>Our Sound</h2>
  <p>
    Here, you’ll find more than records. We curate sounds that move across generations and genres, from timeless boleros and salsa classics to modern urbano and indie Latin pop. We dig deep for rare reissues, highlight local artists, and celebrate the ever-evolving soundscape of Latin music. Every album on our shelves has a story, and every visitor adds a verse.
  </p>

  <h2>Visit Us</h2>
  <p>
    Stop by to browse, to listen, or simply to talk. Spin a new find at our listening station, catch a weekend DJ set, or ask our staff for a personalized recommendation. We believe a good record store should feel like an open conversation rather than just a place to shop for vinyl.
  </p>

  <h2>Join the Community</h2>

    Whether you are a lifelong collector or discovering vinyl for the first time, you will always have a home at Música, Maestro. We buy, sell, and trade with honesty and enthusiasm, and we always have time for a good story behind a great record. ¡Bienvenidos siempre!
